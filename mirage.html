								<h1>"Mirage"</h1>
								<p class="portfolio_item_main_text">Animated short film currently in production, planned to premiere May 2021. Created by students of <i>CNM 190: Advanced Digital Animation</i> at UC Berkeley. Production tools include: Autodesk Maya, Substance Painter, Houdini, Pixar's RenderMan, Nuke, Adobe After Effects, Photoshop. My personal contributions to the project are detailed below.</p>

							<h2>January 29, 2021: Shading</h2>
							<p>Over the past month, I shaded our characters' skin. Working primarily in Substance Painter, I used procedural and hand-painted layers to build roughness, bump, and diffuse textures. I used color adjustment layers to create effects like the redness on the nose and fingertips, lighting-based generators to give Jon a sunburn, and masked displacement layers to sculp the details on the ears, hands, and more. I built the shader network and applied subsurface scattering using RenderMan in Maya.</p>

							<h2>December 11, 2020: Shading, Scripting, and Rigging</h2>
							<p>This week I've worked on blendshapes and eye rigs. I also continued to develop my Substance Painter to Renderman workflow tool, adding support for subsurface color textures and different specular modes. The tool can now be used to either create a new PxrSurface or update an existing one. Finally, I'm beginning to work on shading Jon's skin textures.</p>

							<h2>December 4, 2020: Shading, Scripting, and Rigging</h2>
							<p>To create a more efficient workflow between texture creation in Substance Painter and shaders for RenderMan, I wrote a script that automatically creates a PxrSurface network from textures in a given directory. Using the Python Qt library, I built a easy-to-use GUI around this script. I'm now working on adding options for subsurface scattering and better control over specular color maps.</p>
							<p>Additionally, I created Jon's skeleton, following anatomical and rigging references. I then added controllers and constraints to his torso, neck, eyes, arms, and feet, which control IK leg systems. Finally, I refined the shading of the rings using curvature and dirt generators, along with brush details, in Substance Painter.</p>

							<h2>November 20, 2020: Simulation and Shading</h2>
							<p>This week I continued my work on a disintegration simulation in Houdini. I learned how to export animated geometry from Maya that is more simple to manage in Houdini, and am planning to write a script that handles this relatively complicated workflow. I also worked on shading the rings in Substance Painter, using generators and scratch brushes to make the man’s ring look more worn down and rough. I’m now working on a second pass of the ring textures in response to critiques from my teammates.</p>

							<h2>November 13, 2020: Modeling and Simulation</h2>
							<p>I finished the UV maps for the rings (bands and gems) and the shrub I modeled. Additionally, I learned how to create a Boolean-based disintegration effect in Houdini that maintains the illusion of a solid model (rather than a mesh). For this effect, I’m now working on creating a more realistic particle simulation by varying particle size and color, and making sure that the amount of sand emitted roughly matches the volume of the disintegrated object.</p>

							<h2>November 6, 2020: Modeling and Simulation</h2>
							<p>I made more adjustments to the proportions of the ring models in response to critiques, and began creating UV maps for these. I also created a new model inspired by a shrub found in the Gobi desert. Finally, I’ve continued learning to use Houdini to create a disintegration simulation, and I attempted to find ways to bring work from Houdini into Maya (with little luck, due to the license I currently own). I’m looking into using geometry booleans as a way to get a more volumetric appearance as Lila disintegrates.</p>

							<h2>October 30, 2020: Modeling and Simulation</h2>
							<p>Iterating on the ring models from last week, I refined the braided band and connected it to the prongs. I also increased the sizes of the gems in proportion to the bands, adjusting the ring shape and prongs as needed. Additionally, I’ve been learning how to create the effect of a dissolving object on Houdini, layering stylized edge-geometry effects with turbulent particle simulation. I continued to share thoughts on the story and characters during meetings.</p>

							<h2>October 23, 2020: Modeling and Simulation</h2>
							<p>This week I created first-pass models of the ring bands, including consistent prongs and edge details. I also began to look into several methods of simulation for the disintegration scene, including a realistic approach using nParticles in Maya, and a more stylized version created with Houdini. Finally, I helped make decisions on story changes and the desired appearance of sand simulations.</p>

							<h2>October 16, 2020: Pre-Production and Modeling</h2>
							<p>As we prepared for the class critique, I adjusted the plant designs and then compiled them into an environment drawing. I also contributed toward conversations on story and character design, particularly as we made decisions on the actions and the clothing of Lila. Then, I created two gemstones models, as well as some preliminary test models for the band of Lila’s ring, including one with braids.</p>

							<h2>October 9, 2020: Pre-Production</h2>
							<p>I worked mainly on revising the animatic between each critique, adjusting timing and making decisions on components of the story and details to be cut or emphasized. I also provided feedback for the character and environment design, pushing for a saharan-style desert, and I took notes for the team during Monday’s critique/lecture and parts of the team meetings. Finally, I sketched out a few ideas for the ring assets, trying to make sure they complement each other and fit the characters and premise.</p>

							<h2>October 2, 2020: Pre-Production</h2>
							<p>This week I focused on references and concept art for the environment design of Mirage. I helped create a slide deck with images of stormy deserts, desert vegetation from the Sahara and Gobi deserts, and prop references for the final bedroom shot. I also found a few resources on simulating disintegration in Maya, and put together a list of impactful stories about grief in movies and television to use as inspiration. Finally, I painted desert plants (and one environment sketch) in Photoshop in order to get a better idea of what we may end up modeling.</p>
